## Documentation

## Using

We recommend using [crates from crates.io](https://crates.io/keywords/gtk-rs),
as [demonstrated here](https://gtk-rs.org/#using).

If you want to track the bleeding edge, use the git dependency instead:

```toml
[dependencies]
gdk-pixbuf = { git = "https://github.com/gtk-rs/gtk-rs.git", package = "gdk-pixbuf" }
```

Avoid mixing versioned and git crates like this:

```toml
# This will not compile
[dependencies]
gdk-pixbuf = "0.13"
gdk-pixbuf = { git = "https://github.com/gtk-rs/gtk-rs.git", package = "gdk-pixbuf" }
