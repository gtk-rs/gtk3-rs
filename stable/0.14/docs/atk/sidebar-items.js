AtkHyperlinkImpl differs from AtkHyperlink in that AtkHyperlinkImpl is an interface, whereas AtkHyperlink is a object type. The AtkHyperlinkImpl interface allows a client to query an AtkObject for the availability of an associated AtkHyperlink instance, and obtain that instance. It is thus particularly useful in cases where embedded content or inline content within a text object is present, since the embedding text object implements AtkHypertext and the inline/embedded objects are exposed as children which implement AtkHyperlinkImpl, in addition to their being obtainable via AtkHypertext:getLink followed by AtkHyperlink:getObject."],["HyperlinkStateFlags","Describes the type of link"],["Hypertext","An interface used for objects which implement linking between multiple resource or content locations, or multiple ‘markers’ within a single document.
